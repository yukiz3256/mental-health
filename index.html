<center>What Is Mental Health?</center>
Mental Health is something that includes our emotions, psychology and 
our social wealth. It is different for everyone, it affects how we 
think, act and feel, therefore can change how we handle our
stress and choices. It's not a easy topic to discuss or bring up about,
any can experience mental health problems from child to adulthood. 
From themselves, to family problems to past life experiences. 
Most common illnesses are depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia,
eating disorders, psychotic disorders, and addictive behaviors.
You can take a Mental Health Screening at 
https://screening.mhanational.org/screening-tools/
<center>Symptons</center>
Common symptons are someone feeling helpness, hopeless, getting angry,
tired and hungry often, not being able to sleep, not having an appetite, 
not wanting to talk to family & friends, thinks of harming yourself or others, 
feeling numb or pain, loosing interest or relationships with anything. 

<center> Being Okay</center>
Everyone IS different, and you are not alone. 
Its okay to feel stressed or exhuasted, do not let one thing takeaway 
your whole day! And even so, one bad day does not mean all is over. 
Taking care of yourself should be #1.
Reduce your screen time a little bit, staying away from media is actually
good for your health. Take some time to find a hobby! Drawing, Baking, Cooking,
Do what YOU love. 
Eat well, don't rely on sugar too much either. Sticking to a good healthy diet
can help you have a happier outlook, improve ability to focus and sets yourself
up as well!
Exercise, as much as you might hate it, go for a walk or a run. It reduces your 
negative mood and improves self esteem. Real studies have shown exercising reduces
the risk of developing mental illness.
Talk to someone! You never know, you may feel relief after you let it all out.
Lastly, it is absolutely okay to take a break. Taking care of yourself is 
self care. We can come back with new experiences, more producitivty, motivation,
and creativeness.

There should be this app, where specifically it’s for teens that struggle
to download. It could be for homework help, ranting, looking for clothes and 
shoe suggestions, etc. Some of us have a hard time speaking up, about almost 
anything. So this app is finding new friends that you might not ever even 
meet. This will make many teens feel better to talk to someone about something
or maybe something that's embarrassing but could never talk to their real life
friends about it. For someone that struggles or keeps many things in, they have
a harder time speaking out, texting may not feel like the best way to let it 
out for them. There's many communication or social apps out there already, 
but I personally would not feel safe puting my voice out there. I was thinking
with this app, it can have a voice changer option, you can open the app and 
pair with someone to talk to. Then you and the other person may have a 
conversation and talk about similar problems or help each other out. 
With a voice changer and app that only allows teens to download , it’ll make
many of us feel more comfortable and not so afraid.
